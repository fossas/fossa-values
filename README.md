The following README lists the FOSSA engineering team's values. These values take the form of statements, and are explained in more depth in the paragraphs that follow.

## Suggesting Additions or Changes (team only)
We expect these values to evolve over time so they can accurately reflect the attitude of the team as it develops and grows.

## Values

*Each engineer **acts in good faith**, and they **trust their teammates to act in good faith**.*

This value outlines the primary assumption upon which our team's trust is built. We use the phrase "acts in good faith" to refer to how each engineer acts with honest and sincere intentions.


*Each engineer is **transparent** and **open** with their teammates.*

This value encourages a workplace improved through constructive criticism and honest, civil conversations. Each engineer is encouraged to be pragmatic about the challenges they face (work-related or personal) and to vocalize their concerns to their teammates so they can receive the support or feedback they need.


*Each engineer **does not judge their teammates for what they do not know**, and themselves **feel secure in acknowledging what they do not know**.*

This value seeks to establish our team as a safe space where gaps in knowledge are discovered and filled together, with no judgment imparted throughout this ongoing process.


*Each engineer **is a resource for their teammates**, and is willing to help when they are needed. Each engineer also **feels secure in asking for help when they need it**.*

This value establishes that every member of our team brings something valuable to the table. This value also ties in with the previous value in that each engineer is willing to help fill in the gaps when a teammate needs help in their area of expertise. Asking for help will never negatively impact your standing on the team.


*Each engineer **aspires to best practices**, but is also **willing to err on the side of scrappiness to get the job done**.*

This value acknowledges the reality of balancing engineering ideals with what actually happens. We aim to follow engineering best practices to maintain and pursue a high quality development environment, but we also recognize the importance of getting things shipped. There is value in failing quickly and adapting.


*Each engineer has a **bias to action** and spends their time as impactfully as possible.*

If an engineer sees something they think should be fixed or improved, they are empowered to take action to address it.


*Each engineer is here because **being on this team helps them achieve their goals**.*

This value reflects our expectation that each engineer believes that they find value in being on our team in the present and contributing to it. Each engineer should feel that being on the team elevates them as an engineer and person.

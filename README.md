# FOSSA engineering values

This document describes the kind of team we are, and the kind of team we aspire to be.

We use this document as a reference for the values that our team has agreed on, and as a basis for decision-making:

- Recruiting: designing our interview process and evaluating candidates.
- Individual growth and feedback: evaluating whether we're growing in the ways we want to grow.
- Team strategy: determining how we invest time and prioritize needs.

## Values

### We act openly, transparently, and in good faith

- We act in good faith, and we trust our teammates to act in good faith.
- We value honesty, openness, and transparency over conflict avoidance.
- We have open and civil discussions, even about uncomfortable topics.
- We provide honest, critical, and constructive feedback while still being kind.
- We take shared ownership of our team and our product.

### We lift each other up

- We are eager to teach, but low ego.
- We always help a teammate in need.
- We go out of our way to watch out for when teammates might need help.
- We deliberately create an environment that normalizes transparency, feedback, and safety.
- We uphold our obligation to dissent when we don't agree with a course of action.

### We get shit done

- When we see problems, we proactively take ownership in resolving them. When something needs to be done but nobody else is available, we rise to the occasion.
- We make efficient decisions. We value buy-in, not consensus.
- We hold ourselves to a high standard, but understand when to make trade-offs to ship.
- We spend our time as impactfully as possible.
- When we don't feel impactful, we proactively look for places we can have impact.

### We improve deliberately

- We are humble and eager to learn.
- We discuss our team culture, traditions, and processes openly. We experiment with improving how our team works.
- We help each other take ownership of problems, and we ask for help when we need support to effectively own problems we're solving.
- We are open and transparent about our personal motivations, and we work together to achieve our personal goals.
- We don't judge our teammates for what they don't know, and we feel secure in acknowledging what we don't know.
- We feel safe asking for help, and actively create an environment where others feel safe asking for help.

Values are only useful insofar as they are an accurate reflection of our team. As our team evolves, so will the way we think about our core values.
